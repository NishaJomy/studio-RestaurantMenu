# studio-RestaurantMenu
The menu consists of several menu items

Each menu item has a price, description, and category (appetizer, main course, or dessert)

It should be possible to display whether a menu item is new or not

The app should know when the menu was last updated, so visitors can see that the restaurant is constantly changing and adding exciting new items
